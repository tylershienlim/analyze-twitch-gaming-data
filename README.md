#  Analyzing Twitch Gaming Data
by @tylershienlim

## Project Overview
*About Twitch:*

Twitch is the worldâ€™s leading video platform and community where millions of people and thousands of interests collide in a beautiful explosion of video games, pop culture, and conversation. Its live and on-demand video platform forms the backbone of a distribution network for video game broadcasters including professional players, tournaments, leagues, developers and gaming media organizations.

This project has two objectives:
1. Analyze Twitch Gaming Data (Using `SQL`)
2. Visualize Twitch Gaming Data (Using `Python`)


## Technologies & Tools used
- Python
- VSCode
- Jupyter Notebook
- SQL
- Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio 
- Other dependencies as required.

## Prerequisites / Installation

1. Host local server in SSMS using SQL Server Developer
2. Connect SSMS to local hosted SQL Server
3. Load raw data sets (`chat.csv` & `video_play.csv`) into SSMS

*Alternative*
1. Use `convert.py` to convert datasets into `.db` files to use SQLite instead of SSMS

## Data Preprocessing
Data was preprocessed using **Microsoft's SQL Server Management Studio**

## Code Structure
Below is the tree for the code structure.
1. Data is differentiated into raw and processed data
    - Raw data is the original data sources obtained from Codecademy
    - Processed data are the outputs as a result of the SQL Queries executed
    - SQL Queries can be found in the `twitch-exploration.sql` file
2. Using the processed data found in `./data/processed` directory:
    - Bar graph is visualized
    - Pie chart is visualized
    - Line plot is visualized
